## Deployment

## How the game works
Open the game in the browser from the link in deployment (see above). The game starts as soon as the page loads. Start clicking on the cards shown to try and find matching cards! There are 8 different cards each with a matching pair, 16 cards total. Once all 16 cards have been matched up, the game is over. The score is based off a lower attempt count.
